# SOLID-Principles

SOLID is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. Itâ€™s a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle

- **O**pen/Closed Principle

- **L**iskov Substitution Principle

- **I**nterface Segregation Principle

- **D**ependency Inversion Principle


This is a Swift Playground that has code snippets which show how applying SOLID principles effects code design.

For each principle, there are two files in Sources folder;

 - **Before.swift**: A default implementation of sample case

 - **After.swift**: Related Principle applied version of the case

to show the difference clearly.
