 ### Single Responsibility Principle
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

 "Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class."

 There are two example in "**Sources**" folder:
 * **Before.swift**: A default version of example impelemtation.
 * **After.swift**: SRP applied version.
