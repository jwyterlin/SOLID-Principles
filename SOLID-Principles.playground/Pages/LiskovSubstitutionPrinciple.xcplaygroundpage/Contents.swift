 ### Liskov Substitution Principle
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
 
 "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
 
 If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program
 

 ### Example
 
 There are two example in "**Sources**" folder:
 * **Before.swift**: A default version of example impelemtation.
 * **After.swift**: **LSP** applied version.
